# CRUD-api

This project is an implementation of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using FastAPI integrated with a PostgreSQL database. Both the code and the database are isolated in separate Docker containers, ensuring a modular and scalable architecture. Communication between the containers is established through a custom Docker network, allowing FastAPI and PostgreSQL to work together efficiently. This project was developed for study purposes and to demonstrate how to integrate and orchestrate Docker containers in a modern development environment.
